## Background
A new startup TODO-DO is in the business of creating the best TODO app in the world. They already have a React prototype but it's missing just a couple of features. Please help them.

## Tasks
- Make tasks change their status on click (todo -> done, done -> todo)
- Implement editing text for existing tasks
- Implement "Delete all tasks" button

### Bonus
- Implement a toggle near each task highlighting them as "important" (= change task background colour or add an "important" badge to the task)
- Allow deleteing individual tasks
- Allow changing the order of the existing tasks

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
